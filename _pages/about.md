**Public School Council: The Collaboration Crew!**

Welcome to the Public School Council, where we're the Avengers of the school community: no superpowers, just lots of enthusiasm and snacks! 

Our mission? To rally parents, teachers, and those savvy students who know when pizza day is, all to gather input and create actions that meet the needs of our diverse community.

Think of us as chefs whipping up the perfect recipe for success: a pinch of parent ideas, a dash of student feedback, and a sprinkle of teacher wisdom. 

Join us as we work together to make our school the best it can be, one collaborative meeting at a time!
